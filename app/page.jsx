   Being dominated by uncertainity and randomness, life per se, is only a game of unpredictability. Watching carriages come and go in the city, you may easily come to conclusion that they are just too many. When you are in urgent business, you will be much agitated by the unavailability even though you double the fare. It's said that "time and tide wait for no man" and "The gods send nuts to those who have no teeth". Whenever any physical or mental exertion render naught, i will say it's a matter of time, it's a matter of chance...

“The measures, then,” he continued, “ were good in their kind, and well executed; their defect lay in their being inapplicable to the case, and to the man. A certain set of highly ingenious resources are, with the Prefect, a sort of Procrustean bed, to which he forcibly adapts his designs. But he perpetually errs by being too deep or too shallow, for the matter in hand; and many a schoolboy is a better reasoner than he.”

‘When I wish to find out how wise, or how stupid, or how good, or how wicked is any one, or what are his thoughts at the moment, I fashion the expression of my face, as accurately as possible, in accordance with the expression of his, and then wait to see what thoughts or sentiments arise in my mind or heart, as if to match or correspond with the expression.’

A Procrustean bed is a metaphor derived from Greek mythology, specifically the story of Procrustes, a rogue blacksmith and bandit who had an iron bed in his lair. Procrustes would capture unsuspecting travelers and force them to lie on the bed. If the victims were too long for the bed, he would amputate their limbs, and if they were too short, he would stretch them until they fit.

The term "Procrustean bed" has come to symbolize any situation in which a rigid standard or solution is applied, regardless of the specific circumstances or individual differences. In essence, it represents a one-size-fits-all approach that can be harmful or counterproductive when applied without considering the unique aspects of a particular situation or person.

For example, a Procrustean bed might refer to the insistence on using a particular management style or educational approach for all employees or students, even when it's clear that different individuals might benefit from different approaches.
